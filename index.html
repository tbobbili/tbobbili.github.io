            I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Management Information Systems with a certificate in Computer Science. I am from Houston, Texas and I have a little brother and a dog. I have been swimming competetively since I was 7 but I love hanging out with my friends doing anything active. </p>
